# üõ°Ô∏è Suricata Detection Rules - Captured Alerts

This document contains the Suricata detection alerts visualized in Kibana as part of the SOC Blue Team Lab project. Each alert represents a different threat scenario, demonstrated and analyzed within the environment.



## üöÄ 1. HTTP GET Flood Detected

![HTTP GET Flood Detected](../../images/HTTPSGETFloodDetected.jpg)

**Description:**  
A high volume of HTTP GET requests was detected, which is indicative of a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attempt, specifically an HTTP GET Flood attack.



## üîí 2. Suspicious HTTPS Connections

![Suspicious HTTPS Connections](../../images/HTTPSSuspiciousConnections.jpg)

**Description:**  
Multiple TLS/HTTPS connections were flagged as suspicious. This could indicate reconnaissance activity or automated scanning tools trying to enumerate HTTPS services.



## üåê 3. ICMP DoS Attack Detected

![ICMP DoS Attack Detected](../../images/ICMPDoSAttackDetected.jpg)

**Description:**  
ICMP traffic flood detected. This behavior is typical of an ICMP DoS attack where the attacker tries to exhaust network resources using ICMP Echo Requests.



## üîç 4. Nmap ACK Scan Detected

![Nmap ACK Scan Detected](../../images/NMAPAckScanDetected.jpg)

**Description:**  
Suricata detected a network scan consistent with Nmap ACK scan behavior. This scan type is used to map firewall rules and identify ports that are not filtered.



## ‚ö†Ô∏è 5. Possible XSS Attack Detected

![Possible XSS Attack Detected](../../images/PossibleXSSAttackDetected.jpg)

**Description:**  
A potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack was detected, where malicious scripts might have been injected in HTTP requests to manipulate client-side scripts.



## üß© 6. Services Ports Scan Detected

![Services Ports Scan Detected](../../images/ServicesPortsScanDetected.jpg)

**Description:**  
Port scanning activity was identified targeting well-known service ports (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, MySQL). This behavior is commonly associated with reconnaissance attacks.



## üîë 7. SSH Brute Force Attack Detected

![SSH Brute Force Attack Detected](../../images/SSHBruteForceDetected.jpg)

**Description:**  
Suricata detected repeated attempts to gain unauthorized access to the SSH service by brute force password guessing.



## üìÑ Summary

All these events were generated in a controlled lab environment as part of threat detection, analysis, and Blue Team defense exercises using Suricata, ELK Stack, and Wazuh.
